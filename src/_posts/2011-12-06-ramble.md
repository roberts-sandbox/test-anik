I interviewed a recent college graduate, today. He attended the
Texas A&M. That's a good school, from what I understand. The inventor
of C++ teaches there. The inventor of C++, the language that
popularized object-oriented programming. That sounds like a pretty
good place to earn one's Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. As a 
student there, maybe you'll learn more than data structure and
algorithms. Maybe, you'll learn a little object-oriented design.

Seems not so much.

Now, I don't run my interviews like most people. I like to think that
when someone interviews with me, they walk away knowing more about
programming than when they walked into the room with the white board.
Since I work in a shop that uses C#, C++, and Python, I want to write
code with other programmers that can express the code they write in
too little time in nice class definitions that promote maintenance. I
don't want to work with programmers that think procedurally. I don't
want to work with programmers that interrogate rather than command.

Since the kid had only the most rudimentary OO skills, I crafted a
forum that would walk us through basic OOD. He listed Python, C, C++, Java,
and Lisp as the languages that he knew. I asked him to write on the whiteboard
compilable Hello World programs in all five of the languages. He succeeded by
writing correct programs in all of the languages but LISP.

Then, I wrote on the board `addToTwo(num:int):int` and asked him to write
compilable programs in the four languages with which he succeeded to answer
the previous question. He succeeded with C (and, therefore C++). I helped him
get through the Java and Python implementations.

We moved on to classes and, with a little help, he wrote some declarations on
the board for the `AddToTwo` class. I completed this exercise with a little
speech about OO.

"So, interview candidate," I said, "you now work at a zoo. You build software
to manage the animals' information at the zoo. What's your favorite animal?"

"Um, the giraffe." On the white board, I wrote:

{% highlight python %}
class Giraffe(object):
  def sound(self):
    return 'mrmmph'

  def vertebrate(self):
    return True
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
for animal in [Giraffe()]:
  print animal.sound(), animal.vertebrate

# prints: mrmmph True
{% endhighlight %}

I asked him to write a class definition for his least favorite animal and add
to the loop. He responded with the following code.

{% highlight python %}
class Rat(object):
  def sound(self):
    return 'squeak'

  def vertebrate(self):
    return True
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
for animal in [Giraffe(), Rat()]:
  print animal.sound(), animal.vertebrate

# prints: mrmmph True
# prints: squeak True
{% endhighlight %}

After complimenting him, I wrote class definitions for `Whale` and `Spider`.

{% highlight python %}
class Whale(object):
  def sound(self):
    return 'splash'

  def vertebrate(self):
    return True
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class Spider(object):
  def sound(self):
    return '*silence*'

  def vertebrate(self):
    return False
{% endhighlight %}

I also extended the loop.

{% highlight python %}
for animal in [Giraffe(), Rat(), Whale(), Spider()]:
  print animal.sound(), animal.vertebrate

# prints: mrmmph True
# prints: squeak True
# prints: splash True
# prints: *silence* True
{% endhighlight %}

"Now," I asked, "what do you think of all of these classes?"

"I don't like them," he replied.

"What should we do about it?"

He thought for the briefest moment. "I think we should have one animal class!"

"Okay. Show me."

He erased what we had and replaced it with something similar to this.

{% highlight python %}
class Animal(object):
  def __init__(self, sound, vertebrate):
    self._sound = sound
    self._vertebrate = vertebrate

  def sound(self):
    return self._sound

  def vertebrate(self):
    return self._vertebrate
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
giraffe = Animal('mrmmph', True)
rat = Animal('squeak', True)
whale = Animal('splash', True)
spider = Animal('*silence*', False)

animals = [giraffe, rat, whale, spider]
for animal in animals:
  print animal.sound(), animal.vertebrate

# prints: mrmmph True
# prints: squeak True
# prints: splash True
# prints: *silence* False
{% endhighlight %}

"Great" I said, though I didn't mean it. "The thing is, they hired another
programmer and he started today. He's the zoo's owner's wife's nephew. At the
same time, the zoo acquired a meerkat and your boos told Jerry (that's the
kid's name, Jerry) to add it to the system. Jerry went ahead and included the
new meerkat in the system."

{% highlight python %}
giraffe = Animal('mrmmph', True)
rat = Animal('squeak', True)
whale = Animal('splash', True)
spider = Animal('*silence*', False)
meerkat = Animal('hakuna matata', False)

animals = [giraffe, rat, whale, spider, meerkat]
for animal in animals:
  print animal.sound(), animal.vertebrate

# prints: mrmmph True
# prints: squeak True
# prints: splash True
# prints: *silence* False
# prints: hakuna matata False
{% endhighlight %}

"Candidate, what's wrong with his code?"

"Well, a meerkat has a spine."

"Yep, that's right. How do we fix it?"

"That's easy. Just make that 'false' a 'true'."

"I agree, that fixes the program. But, it does not fix the design. Jerry can
still make the same mistake. We may miss it, the code could go into
production! Then, some poor second grade  girl will think that a meerkat and
a crab have something more in common than starring in Disney movies."

"Yeah, I see that...." Together, we pondered the board, he and I. Ostensibly,
he thought about a better design. I thought about getting some falafel.
Finally, he said, "Well, we can make two classes, then." He set about writing.

{% highlight python %}
class Vertebrate(object):
  def __init__(self, sound):
    self._sound = sound

  def sound(self):
    return self._sound

  def vertebrate(self):
    return True
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class Invertebrate(object):
  def __init__(self, sound):
    self._sound = sound

  def sound(self):
    return self._sound

  def vertebrate(self):
    return False
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
giraffe = Vertebrate('mrmmph')
rat = Vertebrate('squeak')
whale = Vertebrate('splash')
spider = Invertebrate('*silence*')
meerkat = Vertebrate('hakuna matata')

animals = [giraffe, rat, whale, spider, meerkat]
for animal in animals:
  print animal.sound(), animal.vertebrate

# prints: mrmmph True
# prints: squeak True
# prints: splash True
# prints: *silence* False
# prints: hakuna matata False
{% endhighlight %}

"Now, he can't make a mistake."

"Good," I encouraged him. "Unfortunately, after a night of partying, Jerry
comes in and finds a note that reads, 'Jerry, we just bought a cat. Can you
put it in the software for us?' And, so, he does. Somewhat worse for the wear,
he copies the rat implementation and pastes it at the end like this."

{% highlight python %}
giraffe = Vertebrate('mrmmph')
rat = Vertebrate('squeak')             # Copy
whale = Vertebrate('splash')
spider = Invertebrate('*silence*')
meerkat = Vertebrate('hakuna matata')
cat = Vertebrate('squeak')             # Paste

animals = [giraffe, rat, whale, spider, meerkat, cat]
for animal in animals:
  print animal.sound(), animal.vertebrate

# prints: mrmmph True
# prints: squeak True
# prints: splash True
# prints: *silence* False
# prints: hakuna matata False
# prints: squeak True
{% endhighlight %}

"Then, he packs up and goes home to take some aspirin." The candidate looked
a little put out, at this point. "I know that you wouldn't abide such a
co-worker. However, Jerry enjoys the security of nepitism. So, how can you
fix this?"

(Here's where it all fell apart for me.)

"Well, we could somehow track each sound that's been used to create an animal.
Then, we can ... prevent other animals from getting created that way."

"What happens when the zoo wants to buy another giraffe so that it can have
a renewable supply of giraffes, a family of giraffes with little giraffe
babies? We'll need more than one giraffe in the system, then."

"Right, but ... oh. Ok, we can ..." He went on to explain in ever-confusing
terms about how we could only assign instances of `Vertebrate` that make the
'mrmmph' sound to variables named "giraffe."

I stopped him. "What you're proposing goes way beyond object-oriented design.
Let's just stand back for a moment. What sound do all rats make?"

"'Squeak.'"

"Right. And, what sound do all cats make, assuming they don't have
laryngitis?"

"'Meow.'"

"Right. So, doesn't it make sense that we have classes that control that? That
we have a 'cat' class that knows that it meows because it controls that piece
of information? Remember, classes are about behavior."

"Yeah, I can see that."

"So, let's do that. Does a cat have a spine?"

"Yes."

"Ok. We can make a 'cat' class, then, that uses the 'vertebrate' class. Go
ahead and write that on the board. And, while you're at it, write a new
'spider' class, too."

{% highlight python %}
class Cat(Vertebrate):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Cat, self).__init__('meow')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class Spider(Invertebrate):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Spider, self).__init__('*silence*')
{% endhighlight %}

"Good! Now, modify the printing code that we had for these two animals."

{% highlight python %}
cat = Cat()
spider = Spider()

animals = [cat, spider]
for animal in animals:
  print animal.sound(), animal.vertebrate

# prints: meow True
# prints: *silence* False
{% endhighlight %}

"Excellent! Now, let's evaluate our code. First, can we understand it?"

"Yes."

"I agree. Can Jerry mess it up through his inattention?"

"No."

"Then, we've come up with something good, then. Our classes protect the data
that they need to maintain their identity. In other words, each class protects
its invariants. Well done, Interview Candidate."

Of course, the interview wasn't over. Because, we then talked about
[refactoring]({{ post.url }} "refactoring").
