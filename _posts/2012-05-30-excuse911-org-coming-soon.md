Remember back in 1999 when the Internet still had a shine of youth, a time
when Web sites still used texture-based background images and the ``<layer>``
tag still had meaning? When Web sites looked
[like this?](http://www.truecos.com "True Oil")

For the youngsters in the audience, when an organization would purchase a
domain name, they would plaster a big "UNDER CONSTRUCTION" or "COMING SOON"
page to announce and reassure that something relevant would one day appear.
Well, retro guy that I am, I've done the same thing.

If you head over to [excuse911.com](http://excuse911.com "excuse911.com"),
you'll see the coming soon page for the
[borax.js](https://github.com/realistschuckle/boraxjs)-powered Web site that
I've decided to use for real-world testing the library.

But, I put up the "COMING SOON" page so that I can exert some internal
pressure to get the work done to actually complete it. Working in a relative
vacuum has shown me that, left to my own devices, I'd rather participate in
less productive past times. So, internal pressure, build!

I still feel passionately about *borax.js* and what it represents. I think
that, given a reasonable structure in which to understand REST, that most
developers would enjoy the real power that REST-in-the-browser can give to
them. At least, the way that I see it. And, in the absence of something
standards-like, the definition of REST encompasses so much more than
originally intended.

So, onward and onward. And, don't forget, when you need an excuse in a clinch,
you can always turn to [excuse911.com](http://excuse911.com "excuse911.com").
