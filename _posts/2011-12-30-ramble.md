synopsis: In which I talk about sqlcop's development.

sqlcop now has 248 unit tests that supply documentation and executable
confirmation that it can recognize the following:

* Selecting from a table
* Selecting from one of the following rowset function:
  * CONTAINSTABLE
  * FREETEXTTABLE
  * OPENDATASOURCE
  * OPENQUERY
  * OPENROWSET
  * OPENXML
* Selecting from a user-defined function
* Selecting columns
* Selecting star
* Selecting derived columns
* Limiting selections with
  * ALL
  * DISTINCT
  * TOP
  * TOP PERCENT
  * WITH TIES
{: .nomargin }

The lexer definition is pretty crowded because I chose not to perform
case-insensitive parsing which, now, I rue.

The parser file is starting to get a little ungainly. I need to figure out a
way to better organize it. Also, the parser has no Shift/Reduce or
Reduce/Reduce conflicts! YAY!
