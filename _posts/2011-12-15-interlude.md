In 1993, I joined the U.S. Army Infantry. I saw the movie "Stripes." How bad
could it be?

I had just spent four years studying pure mathematics, hadn't yet discovered
the joy of applying it professionally to computer programming, didn't want to
become an actuary, accountant, or statistician, and had no direction. I
decided to an American thing and take a road trip. On midnight of the Thursday
after the last day of school, we stopped by Tower Records, bought $70 worth of
cassette tapes, and started out to drive Route 66.

Three months later, I had no money, no job, living with a Irish bartendress
who had started to discover all the reasons why we shouldn't live together,
and just needed _something to do._ I felt ready to change the world and had no
vehicle with which to do that. So, I chose a direction that provided that
vehicle in the form of a Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

Two weeks before my twenty-first birthday, I walked into the U.S. Army
recruiting station dressed in vintage tweed sports coat, jeans, and combat
boots.
