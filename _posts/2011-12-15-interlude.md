Reading Assignment:
[A Message to Garcia](http://gamacanada.com/newsletter/message_to_garcia.pdf)

-----

In 1993, I joined the U.S. Army Infantry. I saw the movie "Stripes." How bad
could it be?

I had just spent four years studying pure mathematics, hadn't yet discovered
the joy of applying it professionally to computer programming, didn't want to
become an actuary, accountant, or statistician, and had no direction. I
decided to do an American thing and take a road trip. On midnight of the Thursday
after the last day of school, we stopped by Tower Records, bought $70 worth of
cassette tapes, and started out to drive Route 66.

Three months later, I had no money, no job, lived with a Irish bartendress
who had started to discover all the reasons why we shouldn't live together,
and just needed _something to do._ I felt ready to change the world and had no
vehicle with which to do that. So, I chose a direction that provided that
vehicle in the form of a Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

Two weeks before my twenty-first birthday, I walked into the U.S. Army
recruiting station dressed in vintage tweed sports coat, jeans, and combat
boots. I said, "I want to join the Army." The recruiter looked at me, smiled,
and then screwed me.

I write that facetiously. Without the experiences I had in the Army, I would
be a much worse person. I'd be a person that I wouldn't like from my current
perspective. Those changes came from hardships, boredom, shooting every NATO
weapon created, and the teachings of Captain Larry Aikman.

After learning how to shoot my M16, shine my boots, and shave in subzero
weather at Ft. Benning, GA, the Army sent me to the 2d Armored Division ("Hell
on Wheels") at Fort Hood, Texas. One month after arriving, my First Sergeant,
the guy in charge of beans and bullets, came and said, "Schlak! Didn't you go
to college?"

"Yes, First Sergeant!"

"Come with me. The Battalion Sergeant Major is looking for a driver with
some education." I followed him to Battalion headquarters for the 1/41st
Infantry ("Straight and Stalwart"). There, I sat for 30 minutes until this
bulldog of a man barked at me to enter his office.

"Tell me about yourself, soldier!" Everything this man said ended with an
exclamation mark. I explained that I had finished studying mathematics and
English the previous year. I started to explain my studies in Abstract
Algebra and he interrupted with, "Come with me! The Brigade Operations shop
is looking for a new clerk!"

We walked across Battalion Avenue to the 2d Brigade "S-3 shop," a 45-year old
building on the west side of Battalion Headquarters, where I ended up working
as a glorified typist, go-fer, map maker, and driver for the next year. That
first day I met Captain Aikman, a lean man that considered his duty as a
commissioned office in the United States Army as one of the highest callings
any person could hope to attain. I cranked out good work for a month and
became Captain Aikman's go-to person for getting things done. Every other day,
I would come running to his desk in response to him calling my name only to
find out that he had encountered something irritating and yelled the word,
"FUCK!"

One day he actually yelled, "SCHLAK!," and I came running that ended with a
snap to attention at his desk. "Schlak," he said, "I have something for you
to read." He handed me a thin book, a treatise, a hard-bound pamphlet that
totaled no more than 20 pages. "Read this and we'll talk about it." 

"Yes, sir," I replied. I took the book back to my work area, set it down, and
promptly forgot about it until a week later when I responded to another
bellowed "SCHLAK!" At his desk, I reported, "Yes, sir?"

"Did you read that book I gave to you?"

He had counseled me previously that the best answer is an honest answer. "No,
sir."

"You've had a week, Schlak. Why haven't you read it?"

"I don't know, sir."

"Right." He opened a drawer, took out an 3Ã—5 index card, grabbed a Sharpie,
wrote some words on the index card, all the while saying, "Schlak, I want you
to carry this card in your left breast pocket until I tell you to not carry
it anymore. Every time you see me, I want you to stand at attention, take the
card from your pocket, and read it aloud to me in a military voice."

"Yes, sir," I replied as I took the card from him. On it, in large block
letters, he had written

> I AM A SLUG

For nine days, at least eight times each day, I stopped, took it out, and
said aloud, "I am a slug. Sir!" The first 20 times, I felt embarrassed. By the
end of the nine days, I owned that phrase.

I read that book the first night after receiving the card. Written by Elbert
Hubbard in 1899. The inspirational essay briefly tells the story of Captain
Andrew Rowan who, dropped off on the shores of Cuba with a letter for Calixto
Garcia, one of the leaders of the Cuban revolution, delivered the letter with
the simple instructions, "Get this message to Garcia." It goes on to extol
those virtues of self-sufficiency, avid determination, and the intestinal
fortitude to complete an assignment with a "stiffening of the vertebrae which
will cause them \[you\] to be loyal to a trust, to act promptly, \[and\]
concentrate \[your\] energies."

Since reading that, I have failed the ideal described by "A Message to
Garcia." I have failed that ideal more than once. However, I like to think
that, on the balance, those scales would tip in favor of actions and attitude
similar to those of Andrew Rowan.

And, I try every day, to continue carrying that message to Garcia.
