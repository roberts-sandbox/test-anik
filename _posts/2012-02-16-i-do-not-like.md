I don't like dimes.

They're small. They're pathetic. They've got that ridged edge. They make my
fingers smell like inexpensive metal. They don't represent the greatness of
the man on them, Dwight D. Eisenhower.

I'd rather have two nickels than a dime.

I'd rather have just one nickel.

-----

I don't like frameworks.

They're huge. They're overwhelming. They've got that undocumented API. They
make my fingers sweat from too much implementation. They don't represent the
intelligence of the software programmers that implement them.

I'd rather have two toolkits that solve my problems.

I'd rather have just the compiler.

-----

I don't like eggsalad sandwiches.

They're messy. They're globby. They've got that too-much-mayonnaise problem.
They make my fingers smell like eggs and celery. They don't represent the
deliciousness that a sandwich could achieve.

I'd rather have two ear infections than an eggsalad sandwich.

I'd rather have tuna.

-----

I don't like homegrown IDEs.

They're slow. They're feature-poor. They've got that collection of
bad-usability problems. They make my fingers ache from switching from keyboard
to mouse to keyboard to mouse. They don't represent the polished
state-of-the-art you find in <your fav IDE/text editor>.

I'd rather have two instances of Notepad++ than a homegrown IDE.

I'd rather have a dime.
