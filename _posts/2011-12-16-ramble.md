I planned to write a really good post, today, that clarifies my thoughts about
the decisions behind Câ™­. Unfortunately, I didn't start this post until 8:45pm
without the same fiery passion that I normally bring to these. Instead, I
think I'll just do some stream-of-consciouness poo.

On the [front page](/), I currently have a non-exhaustive list of items on the
desk in my home office. This weekend, I think I'll change that to something
more interesting. And, this is what I think I'll do...

## Write fiction

I've always wanted to write fiction. I have a couple of good story arcs in my
mind. I think I'll pick one and stick with writing it like I have tried to do
with this blog, one-post-per-day. That means that the weekend should see
post-per-weekend of, hopefully, a chapter. That should allow those of you that
like it to have time to read the chapter sometime during the week.

If you have a preference for any of the following titles, please express it as
a comment at the end of this section.

### Left for Dead

Book 1 of The Peripheral Volume

The story explores the relationship between a hard-as-nails private
invetigator and her uneasy relationship with a man who has the power to sense
the residue caused by the death of any living creature by looking into what he

the human race.

### The Pentatuch

A novel in five parts set in the 1980s midwest that observes the actions of an
amoral man as he joins a group of traveling sales people. As "Wall Street"

### The Jester's Court

them to discover which of the members of their group is a killer before
another person dies.

paradise on Earth. A sixteen year old girl and her younger brother must stop
him before his plan destroys civilization.

### The Widower's Plan

ever-increasing self-destructive acts. Before his own appetites consume him,

### Fang and Claw
