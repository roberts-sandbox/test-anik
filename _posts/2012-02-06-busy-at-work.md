synopsis: In which I excuse myself from my normal typing assignment.

I have the opportunity to lead some pretty big training, this Friday. In the
spirit in which I do most everything, I have thrown myself into the position
with abandon. I've made it 17 pages into the supplemental text that I will
distribute. I still have presentations and narrations to create. Busy, busy,
busy.

You have my apologies if you find it discouraging that I will not post
regularly, this week.

I want to make the training interesting and engaging, something difficult to
do for programming. At least the attendees will have computers on which they
can type.
