## BORAX by Example

Just for review, the most common usage pattern of a rich internet application
goes like this:

1. Visitor GETs a main page of the application; visitor can't access page and
   login form is shown
1. Visitor POSTs credentials to server
   * On failure: response contains login page (go to parent step)
   * On success: response contains redirect to original page (go to next step)
1. Visitor GETs page of application
1. Broswer makes GETs and POSTs on behalf of visitor for information
   * Responses most often contain media types ``text/html``, ``text/xml``, or
     ``application/json``
   * For ``text/html``, JavaScript plops new content into DOM
   * For ``text/xml``, JavaScript or browser applies stylesheet and plops
     transformed content into DOM
   * For ``application/json``, JavaScript using out-of-band information
     generates something to plop into the DOM or affect the current items in
     the DOM
1. Visitor interacts with application by GETting and POSTing to various URLs
1. Visitor POSTs to logout URL (go to first step)

I'll start at the top of the list, talk about the current state-of-the-art,
then scrub it clean with some BORAX. First up:

## Authentication - BOOM!

About twelve and one-half years ago, some folks from across the computer
software world got together and wrote
[HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt).
It describes two methods by which a user can authenticate with a server to
prove their identity. The HTTP/1.1 standard references it and the two
authentication methods "Basic" and "Digets" as the two options by which the
'WWW-Authenticate' header can work out-of-the-box. Unfortunately, while the
RFC describes the method by which a browser authenticates, it does not address
the situation where the browser or server wants to abandon the credentials.

That's right: the standard does not provide for "logout."

Oh, did I mention its age: 12-1/2 years old!? If I haven't made a mistake, I
think that describes the Paleolithic era of the Web.

In the interim, almost every single Web application has abandoned the
excellent HTTP status code **401 Unauthorized** and the "WWW-Authenticate"
header because they can't end a session, can't intercept that ugly popup box
the browser throws in front of the user, or can't bother to have to set up
the Web server to make the challenge.

It's just so much easier to present a form and keep some token in the
browser's cookies. And it's prettier. And, it's an opportunity for branding.
Until someone updates this or Kerberos becomes the Internet-wide standard for
authentication, we need something better.

## BORAX handles HTTP codes wisely

Enter BORAX. BORAX registers handlers for different HTTP status codes. That's
important because we want our server to tell us the disposition of the request
which will provide us with much better processing for other types of requests
as well as authentication.

With BORAX, any managed AJAX request that returns a 401 HTTP status code will
use the registered '401 Unauthorized' handler. The default handler probes for
associated content for an authentication form or template in the following
places:

1. The body of the response if the "Content-Type" of the response equals
   ``text/html`` and the body has content
1. The body of the response if the "Content-Type" of the response equals
   ``application/x.borax-linkbase``
1. The body of the response if the "Content-Type" of the response equals
   ``multipart/related`` and the "type" parameter equals
   ``application/x.borax-renderable``
1. In the response for a "Link" header with a relation of
   "authorization-template"
1. In the ``HEAD`` of the currently loaded page for a ``link`` tag with a
   relation of "authorization-template"

Should all of these fail, BORAX will report an error to your application. If
BORAX can find any of these, then it returns an object that your application
can render into the DOM and a login form (assuming that content gets served
by any of those methods) will appear in your browser!

## Or, at least, it will....

I've just started this BORAX project. I haven't completed the specifications
for the BORAX media types. As of the time that I've written this entry, I only
have the code to support the versions of interactions that return
``text/html``. However, since we only want to show a login form, then this
seems like a reasonable time to test the HTML rendering functionality.

That's what I've got, right now. That's what I'll use.

## Code

I usually hate abstracting "standard" libraries. I like to abide by "choose
something and stick with it." Otherwise, you end up with either leaky
abstractions or least-common-denominator APIs. BORAX, though, acts more like
a glue layer than a proper toolkit. That in addition to the religious fervor
surrounding Web developers' preferences has caused some design decisions with
BORAX. The first example of that comes from the AJAX support in BORAX. BORAX
doesn't have any itself; it uses the one that you supply to it.

BORAX's expectations of an AJAX provider does not align itself with any of the
common libraries; you have to write an adapter, if I haven't provided one with
the distribution. Right now, that means jQuery. Later, it will mean whatever
you or I write. I *really like* FOSS for that reason.

### Get BORAX

You can do this two ways. You can download the packaged build or the entire
repository from GitHub from the
[BORAX.js repository](https://github.com/realistschuckle/boraxjs). If you want
to just look at the code, the BORAX repository has an example in the
"example" directory that you can run with ``npm start`` at the root of the
repository.

Right now, you can also point a Web server to that example directory since we
will work with only ``text/html``, ``text/css``, and
``application/javascript``.

### Set up your application's entry point

The entry point for a BORAX-enabled Web application probably consists of just
a basic HTML page. The page can instruct BORAX to transition to the first 
state of the application by calling its ``start`` method with a URL. If you
invoke ``start`` without a URL, then BORAX will look for a ``link`` tag in
the current document with the "x.borax-start" relation type and use the
value of its ``href`` attribute.

For example, the index.html for the example application has the following
content.

{% highlight html linenos %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example BORAX Application</title>
    <link href="/css/index.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="/dashboard.html" rel="x.borax-start">
    <script src="/scripts/jquery-1.7.1.js"></script>
    <script src="/scripts/borax.js"></script>
    <script>
      function handlerContent(renderable) {
        renderable.execute();
        renderable.render(document.body);
        renderable.executeDeferred();
      }
      borax.withAjax(borax.jQuery);
      borax.start(handlerContent);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

which renders

![BORAX authentication handler](/img/borax-auth-1.png)

Line 6 of the start page indicates to BORAX that, on start, it should 
transition state from the current state (nothing) to the start state
represented by the relative URL ``/dashboard.html``.

Unfortunately, the server protects that resource from unauthorized access.
BORAX receives the 401 from the server. The communication between BORAX and
the server went something like this.

{% highlight bash %}
GET /dashboard.html HTTP/1.1
Accept:*/*
Accept-Charset:ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding:gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language:en-US,en;q=0.8
Cache-Control:max-age=0
Connection:keep-alive
Host:localhost:8181
Referer:http://localhost:8181/
User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0
X-Requested-With:XMLHttpRequest
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="highlight">
<pre>
<code>
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Connection:keep-alive
Content-Type:text/html
Transfer-Encoding:chunked

&lt;link href="css/401.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
&lt;form id="login-form" action="." method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div class="input-row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="image-holder"&gt;
        &lt;img src="images/borax.png" height="157" width="200" alt="borax"&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="input-row"&gt;
      &lt;input type="email" name="username" placeholder="Registered Email"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="input-row"&gt;
      &lt;input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="input-actions"&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Allow me in!&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>
</pre>
</div>

BORAX parses that response so that renderers can intelligently deal with the
different aspects of how tags should appear in the actual page. In this case,
BORAX accesses the ``link`` tag and puts it into the **head** of the visible
document. Then, it puts the remainder, the ``form`` node, into the **body** of
the main document.

This gave you a glimpse of how BORAX handles different media types and
response codes. More on BORAX will come in future posts as I complete more
code. I think a friend and I will use it to create a new crapplication for the
Web that allows people to get excuses to call into work sick, hurt, lost, or
malaise-filled. It's a funny idea. And, as the app grows, we will have the
ability to create BORAX for a real-working application.
