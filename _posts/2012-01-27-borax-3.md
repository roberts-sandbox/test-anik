As you may recall from the [last BORAX post](/2012/01/25/borax-2.html), I had
set up the application to transition to the start state which, for the
purposes of our application, means someone needs to login. The application
loads its first state as indicated by a linked relation in the header of the
launchpad. Now, I sure think we would find it cool if we could handle the
authentication.

## Following along

This post will also cover some server-side development. If you want to follow
along, install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and play with it. If you and
others end up liking BORAX and its ability to make REST easy, then we can
build bindings for non-node.js platforms.

If you want to start from the last post, clone the
[BORAX.js repository](https://github.com/realistschuckle/boraxjs) from GitHub
and switch to the "post-1" tag.

## Some server-side lovin'

If you look at the current "example/server.js" in the repository, you'll see a
mess. Just a mess. Blech. Bad Curtis! But, every mess means a refactoring (or
rewriting) opportunity!

Since this portion of the application deals with authentication, I think it
would rock if I include the protection of resources in a server-side library
that I will start writing in this post. The "lib/borax-in-server.js" will
contain, obviously, the server-side components for BORAX on node.js.

It seems that the normal method for hooking in middleware to things like
[express.js](http://expressjs.com/) and [flatiron.js](http://flatironjs.org/)
takes the form of a function with three parameters: the
``http.ServerRequest``, the ``http.ClientResponse``, and some ``next``
function to call if the registered handler did not fully handle the request.
I can do the same here, I think.
{: class=clearnone}

Following the <abbr title="Keep It Simple, Stupid">KISS</abbr> with the
perspective that "simple" refers to the use of the API, I think I can get away
with the following.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var http = require('http')
  , boris = require('borax-in-server')
  , credential_function = require('my-auth-lib').authenticate
  ;

var auth = boris.auth(credential_function, content_function);
auth.addTree('/');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  auth.protect(req, res, function() {
    // Normal request processing.
  });
}).listen(8181);

/* Or, if you use flatiron or the like, something like:
app.http.before.push(auth.protect);
*/
{% endhighlight %}

This would protect the path represented by '/' (the root) and all paths that
would fall beneath it. That matches the requirements for the example
application pretty nicely.

I'll list the stories that describe ``boris``. You can check out the tests and
what not in the project.

**For the borax-server library:**

* It has an ``auth`` function that requires:
  * a function that checks the credentials sent to the server; and,
  * a function that provides the content of the template to the response
    object
* The ``auth`` method returns a non-null object called the *protector*.
* The *protector* has an ``addTree`` function that requires a string.
* The *protector* has a ``protect`` function that requires the following three
  arguments:
  * an object that represents the client's request with "url" and "headers"
    attributes;
  * an object that represents the server's response; and,
  * a function that the *protector* can call if the resource needs no
    protection
* When the *protector* receives a request that matches a string passed to
  ``addTree``, then it:
  * sets the responses status code to 401;
  * writes a header with the key 'WWW-Authenticate' and a value 'Borax-Basic';
    and,
  * writes the return value of the *content_function* to the body of the
    response.
* When the *protector* receives a request that starts with the string passed
  to ``addTree``, then it performs the same steps as in the last section
* When the *protector* receives a request that does not start with nor equals
  a value passed to ``addTree``, then it calls the *next* function.
* When the *protector* receives a request that contains an 'Authorization'
  header, then it decomposes the data in the header and passes it to the
  credentials function with the scheme name.
* If the credentials function returns **true**, then the protector calls the
  ``next`` callback; otherwise,
* If the credentials function returns **false**, then the protector returns
  the challenge, again.

I changed the "server.js" file to use this new BORAX-provided asset
protection. Now, things seem a little more reasonable. If I used **flatiron**
or **express**, then I would have even less SLOCs in the server file. The
following code abridges the actual server file and shows only the
BORIS-related code.

{% highlight javascript %}
var creds = function(scheme, params) {
  return scheme == 'Borax-Basic' &&
         params['name'] == 'curtis' &&
         params['password'] == 'password';
};

var challenge = function(res) {
  var _401 = path.join('example', path.join('assets', '401.html'));
  fs.readFile(_401, function(err, data) {
    if(err) {
      res.writeHead(404, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
      res.end('File Not Found');
      return;
    }
    res.writeHead(401, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
    res.end(data);
  });
}

var protector = boris.auth(creds, challenge);
                     .addTree('/dashboard.html');

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  var url = urlparse(req.url);
  var asset_path = path.join('./example', url.pathname);
  fs.stat(asset_path, function(err, stat) {

    /* Use the protector to guard the configured path from above. */
    protector.protect(req, res, function() {
      if(stat && stat.isDirectory()) {
        asset_path = path.join(asset_path, 'index.html');
      }
      var ext = path.extname(asset_path);
      fs.readFile(asset_path, function(err, data) {
        if(err) {
          res.writeHead(404, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
          res.end('File Not Found');
          return;
        }
        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': mediaTypeExtensions[ext]});
        res.end(data);
      });
    });
  });
});
{% endhighlight %}
