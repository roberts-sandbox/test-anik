I've used [openclipart.org](http://openclipart.org "Open Clip Art") for a long
time, I've always meant to submit something of my own. Because the site has an
open submission policy, you can find some less-than-nice work on the site.

Finally, I have something good enough that I wanted to make it available to
the world. [Here's the clip art page](http://openclipart.org/detail/170351/worried-woman-by-realistschuckle-170351)
over at the site from which you can download the SVG or PNG of various sizes.
If you like it, go on over there and "favorite" it.
