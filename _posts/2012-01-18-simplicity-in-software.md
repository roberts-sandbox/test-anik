I had an opportunity to speak with a pretty smart software developer last week
about a toolkit I wrote. He asked me how it made his life simpler because by
using the toolkit he had to write four more lines of code than he would
without using the toolkit. It was at that point that I realized that he and I
didn't have the same definition of "simpler."

After many years of writing software, my definition of "simpler" means the
most maintainable. That implies a lot. It does not imply minimizing lines of
code, especially with object-oriented programming.

## The myth of fewer lines of code
