(You can catch up from the last post where the candidate and I talked about
[simple class design]({{ site.posts.last.url }} "simple class design").)

"So, Interview Candidate, let's look at the classes that we have."

{% highlight python %}
class Vertebrate(object):
  def __init__(self, sound):
    self._sound = sound

  def sound(self):
    return self._sound

  def vertebrate(self):
    return True
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class Invertebrate(object):
  def __init__(self, sound):
    self._sound = sound

  def sound(self):
    return self._sound

  def vertebrate(self):
    return False
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class Cat(Vertebrate):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Cat, self).__init__('meow')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class Spider(Invertebrate):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Spider, self).__init__('*silence*')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
cat = Cat()
spider = Spider()

animals = [cat, spider]
for animal in animals:
  print animal.sound(), animal.vertebrate

# prints: meow True
# prints: *silence* False
{% endhighlight %}

"We've ensured that the 'cat' and 'spider' classes protect the invariant data
that each contains, namely, the sound each animal makes. Now, do you see any
refactoring opportunities?"

"... what's refactoring?"

"Oh, ok. You'll hear a lot of people throw that word around in the software
development space. Quite often, you'll find that developers and especially
management will use the word 'refactoring' to mean changing the code. However,
a really smart guy named Opdyke first used the word and I think his meaning
has the most merit. Specifically, refactoring code means that you change the
implementation of the code without altering the existing behavior. Remember,
in object-oriented programming, behavior is king."

"So, you want me to make this code better but without changing the
way it works?"

"Precisely. And, usually, better means simpler."

"Well, both the 'vertebrate' and 'invertebrate' classes do the same thing."

"What do you mean?"

"They both take a sound value and return it. We can make it simpler by making
a single class that handles that." I nodded my assent and he went to work.

{% highlight python %}
class Animal(object):
  def __init__(self, sound):
    self._sound = sound

  def sound(self):
    return self._sound
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class Vertebrate(Animal):
  def vertebrate(self):
    return True
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class Invertebrate(Animal):
  def vertebrate(self):
    return False
{% endhighlight %}

"I agree. That makes it simpler. Now, do you see anything else that we can
simplify?"

He looked studiously at the board, concentration causing a slight tightening
around his eyes. I directed my gaze out the window and thought some more about
that falafel I had for lunch. It tasted better than normal, that day, but the
hummus didn't have enough tahini....

"No, I don't see anything."

"No problem. Would you agree that less code would mostly result in simpler
code?"

"Yeah."

"Ok, then I'd like to examine the way that we handle the sound in the
'animal' class. We're working in Python, so we get a lot of expressive power
that we won't get in languages that have attributes resolved at compile time.
Where does the 'cat' class keep its 'meow' sound?"

"In its initializer."

"Right. Does it have to keep it there? Where else could it keep that piece of
data?"

"In a field?"

"Right. Do that for me."

{% highlight python %}
class Cat(Vertebrate):
  def __init__(self):
    self._sound = 'meow'
    super(Cat, self).__init__(self._sound)
{% endhighlight %}

"Nicely done, Interview Candidate. Now that you have set it in that variable,
how can we change the 'animal' class' implementation to take advantage of it?"

{% highlight python %}
class Animal(object):
  def sound(self):
    return self._sound
{% endhighlight %}

"Like that?"

"Exactly. Now, I think we can simplify this a little more. What sound does a
gray cat make?"

He looked at me oddly and replied, "Meow."

"Right. Now, what sound does a torty make?"

"A what?!"

"Sorry, cat lover. What sound does an orange cat make?"

"Meow."

"So, what sound does every cat in the world make that doesn't suffer from
laryngitis?"

"Meow."

"Right again. Can you infer something from this small exercise of the Socratic
method?"

Pause. "No."

"No problem. In what kind of variable have you stored 'meow?'"

"Um, a normal variable?"

"Yes, that's true. Nothing special about it. However, you have stored it in
an instance varaible. Which means that each instance of every cat in our
system has its own special copy of it. Does that seem like a waste?"

"Yes, it does."

"If we've encountered a waste, then that usually means we can write better
code. Let me show you."

{% highlight python %}
class Cat(Vertebrate):
  SOUND = 'meow'
{% endhighlight %}

"Now, this implies to the reader of the class definition that the fact that a
cat makes a 'meow' sound belongs to _all_ cats and not just each one
individually. We can change the 'animal' class to take advantage of this and
the 'spider' class to meet the expectations of the 'animal' class."

{% highlight python %}
class Animal(object):
  def sound(self):
    return self.SOUND
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class Spider(Invertebrate):
  SOUND = '*silence*'
{% endhighlight %}

"Not only have we simplified the code by removing lines that didn't add value
to the behavior, we've also created an implication in the use of the 'animal'
class. Can you spot it?"

"Yeah. You can't get the animal's sound without having some class that
provides that capital 'SOUND' variable."

"Right-o. Now, when Jerry breaks the system by writing bad code, we can spot
it more easily because he has not met the expectation of 'animal.' We have
allowed behavior to govern the system. Nice work, Interview Candidate."
