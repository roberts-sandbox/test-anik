The agile dream: 40-hour work weeks. If you work more than 40 hours, don't do
it two weeks in a row.

I have not complied with that directive over the past three months.

Instead, my minimum work week has consisted of 60 hours.

My mind does not want to create. It merely wants to rest.

Alas, this post is nothing. Mere filler.

It is my **empty word**.
