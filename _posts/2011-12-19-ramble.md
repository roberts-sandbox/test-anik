I talked with my friend [philipmat](http://philipm.at/), today, about some of
the bad practices that I identified for C♭. After our conversation, he
recommended that I take some time to clarify my perspective. So, here I will
do that without irony, with sincerity, instead.

The following sections contain some clarifications for the "features" of C♭
that I identified in [Part 1](/2011/12/12/ramble.html).

## Methods only take one parameter and it's a lambda/Func/Action.
philipmat and I agree that passing a callable to a method has a real place in
design, most notably when we pass filter functions to LINQ methods or when we
pass a factory function to Autofac's registration methods. We should also pass
lambdas as arguments when the target method expects an `Expression` for
runtime inspection of abstract syntax trees.

However, when we pass anonymous methods as part of the behavior of a class,
then we've strayed from comprehensible code. We've left the world of good
object-oriented programming. That may sound like too purist of a view;
however, we must write maintainable code, code that others can understand.
When I have to jump back and forth and 

philipmat suggested that I make the requirement read something like
