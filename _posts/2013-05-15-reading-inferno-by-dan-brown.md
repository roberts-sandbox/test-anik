I'm reading [Inferno](http://books.google.com/books?isbn=0804121060) by Dan
Brown of [The Da Vinci Code](http://books.google.com/books?isbn=9780307277671)
fame.

I don't like it much. It does hold my attention more than
[The Lost Symbol](http://books.google.com/books?isbn=1400079144). Barely.

Oddly enough, its main plot device is the same plot device I wanted to use in my
own untitled novel planned a couple of years ago but never written.

If I write it now, everyone will just say, "That's so derivative." And, in
anything other than calculus, derivative just ain't no compliment.

Oh well. Opportunity lost.

See you tomorrow.
