Back on [2 March](/2012/03/02/custom-wpf-tab-control.html) and
[3 March](/2012/03/05/chrome-tabs-and-visual-children.html), I wrote about the
WPF tab control based on the tabs found in the Google Chrome browser that I
had started in the
[wpfchrometabs project on GitHub](https://github.com/realistschuckle/wpfchrometabs).

Well, I spent some time on it, this week, to make it usable. For you.

* Close buttons for each tab
* A nice little add button
* Tab reordering with graceful animations
* A bunch of little bug fixes

Here's a little recording that you can view directly on Vimeo by heading over
to [WPF Chrome Tabs](http://vimeo.com/44969662).

&nbsp;
{: id="player" }

<script type="text/javascript">
window.setTimeout(function() {
  var f = document.createElement('iframe');
  f.width = 500;
  f.height = 333;
  f.frameborder = 0;
  f.style.border = '0';
  f.src = 'https://player.vimeo.com/video/44969662?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0';
  document.getElementById('player').appendChild(f);
}, 1000);
</script>
